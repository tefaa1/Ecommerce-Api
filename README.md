# E-Commerce REST API

A powerful and production-ready E-Commerce Backend API built with Spring Boot, following clean architecture principles with a layered structure (Controller, Service, Repository). The project uses DTOs for request/response abstraction, input validation, and includes Redis integration for secure token blacklisting. Designed for scalability, maintainability, and real-world deployment.
